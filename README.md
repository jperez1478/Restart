# Restart
Sometimes we feel discouraged. 
Sometimes we are vastly disappointed too. If so, by practicing solitude we can feel better and focused. 

# Main Learning Obejectives of this Swft UI project  is to create a onboarding view with animation 

The goal is for me is to learn how to add animations to onboarding views

Things learned throughout this project 

1. Advance App Design 

2. Complex Features 
We will create such a custom button with complex gestures that we can not find in Appleâ€™s stock user interface library.

3. Parallax Effect
By using multiple movements in the opposite direction (parallax effect) we can add depth to this  onboarding screen.
